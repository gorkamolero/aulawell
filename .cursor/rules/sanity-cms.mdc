# Sanity CMS Integration

## Sanity Integration Patterns
- Schemas in `sanity/schemas/` with proper validation
- GROQ queries defined in `lib/sanity.ts`
- Client configured with CDN, preview tokens, and visual editing
- Image URLs generated with custom `getImageUrl` helper

## Schema Guidelines
- Use camelCase for schema names (e.g., `successStory.ts`)
- Proper validation rules for all fields
- Clear field descriptions for content editors
- Order fields logically for better UX

## Content Management
- All content managed through Sanity CMS
- Preview mode for content editors
- Visual editing integration
- Structured data for SEO

## GROQ Query Examples
```javascript
// Featured testimonials
*[_type == "testimonial" && featured == true] | order(_createdAt desc)[0...3]

// Services with full details
*[_type == "service"] | order(order asc) {
  _id,
  title,
  slug,
  shortDescription,
  fullDescription,
  icon,
  price,
  duration,
  features,
  subjects,
  featured
}
```

## Image Handling
- Use `getImageUrl()` helper for image URLs
- Optimize images with proper dimensions
- Include alt text for accessibility
