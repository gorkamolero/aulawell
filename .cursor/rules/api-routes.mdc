# API Routes & Email System

## API Route Patterns
- Located in `app/api/` following App Router conventions
- Handle errors gracefully with proper HTTP status codes
- Use TypeScript interfaces for request/response types
- Email APIs integrate with Resend service

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for failed API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for development debugging
- Proper HTTP status codes in API responses

## Email System Integration
### Email Templates
- Built with React Email components
- Templates stored in Sanity CMS for easy management
- Automated sequences (welcome emails, contact confirmations)
- Admin dashboard for testing and management

### Email Types
- **Contact form confirmations**: Sent to users
- **Admin notifications**: Sent to tutors
- **Welcome sequences**: Multi-step onboarding emails
- **Test emails**: For development/testing

## Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`: Sanity project ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`: Sanity dataset (production/development)
- `SANITY_VIEWER_TOKEN`: Server-side Sanity token
