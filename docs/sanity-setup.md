# Sanity CMS Setup Guide

This guide will help you complete the Sanity CMS setup for the Aulawell website.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- pnpm package manager
- A Sanity account (sign up at https://sanity.io)

## 1. Create a Sanity Project

1. Visit https://sanity.io and sign up/log in
2. Create a new project:
   - Choose a project name (e.g., "Aulawell")
   - Select "Blog" or "Clean" template (we'll replace the schema)
   - Choose your preferred region for data hosting

## 2. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Update `.env.local` with your Sanity project details:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-from-sanity
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2024-01-01
   SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET=a-secure-random-string
   ```

## 3. Initialize Sanity in Your Project

Run the following command to initialize Sanity with your existing project:

```bash
npx sanity@latest init --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID --dataset production
```

When prompted:
- Choose to use TypeScript: Yes
- Choose to use an existing project: Yes
- Select your project from the list
- Use the default dataset name: production

## 4. Deploy Sanity Studio

To make your Sanity Studio accessible online:

```bash
npx sanity@latest deploy
```

Choose a studio hostname (e.g., `aulawell-cms`).

## 5. Access Sanity Studio

You can access your Sanity Studio in two ways:

### Local Development
Visit: http://localhost:3000/studio

### Production
Visit: https://your-studio-hostname.sanity.studio

## 7. Set Up Webhooks (Optional)

To enable automatic revalidation when content changes:

1. Go to your Sanity project settings
2. Navigate to "API" â†’ "Webhooks"
3. Create a new webhook:
   - Name: "Next.js Revalidation"
   - URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/sanity/revalidate`
   - Dataset: production
   - Trigger on: Create, Update, Delete
   - Secret: Use the same value as `SANITY_REVALIDATE_SECRET`

## 8. Content Management Best Practices

### Order Fields
Most content types include an "order" field to control display sequence. Lower numbers appear first.

### Featured Content
Testimonials and success stories can be marked as "featured" to appear prominently on the homepage.

### SEO
Blog posts include SEO metadata fields for search engine optimization.

### Images
Always add alt text to images for accessibility and SEO.

## 9. Integration with Next.js

The following utilities are available for fetching content:

```typescript
import { 
  getTestimonials, 
  getServices, 
  getTeamMembers 
} from '@/sanity/lib/fetch'

// In your components
const testimonials = await getTestimonials()
const services = await getServices()
```

## 10. Portable Text Rendering

For rich text content, use the PortableTextRenderer component:

```tsx
import { PortableTextRenderer } from '@/sanity/lib/portableText'

function MyComponent({ content }) {
  return <PortableTextRenderer content={content} />
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Studio not loading**: Check your environment variables are correct
2. **Content not updating**: Verify webhook configuration and secrets
3. **Images not displaying**: Ensure image URLs are generated with `urlFor()`
