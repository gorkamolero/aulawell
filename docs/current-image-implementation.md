# Current Image Implementation Progress

## What We've Done
1. Added two student studying images to the home page:
   - Hero section: `/images/Student Studying 1.jpeg` - Replaced placeholder
   - About Preview section: `/images/Student Studying 2.png` - Added with 2-column layout

2. Set up Unsplash MCP server:
   - Installed: `claude mcp add unsplash-images npx @okooo5km/unsplash-mcp-server-go`
   - API Key added to ~/.zshrc: `UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY="nlAY1kSapxQ0jp7tML-Dmi770dj3_Rl3rCsFLhaxAjA"`

## Images We Need to Find
Priority images for the tutoring website:

### High Priority
1. **Professional tutor headshot** - For Amy on About page
2. **Online tutoring session** - Video call tutoring screenshot
3. **Student success/celebration** - For success stories

### Medium Priority
4. **UK school building** - Prestigious education setting
5. **Diverse student portraits** - For success story cards
6. **Exam/studying scenes** - For services page

### Lower Priority
7. **Madrid cityscape** - For contact page
8. **Business professionals** - For adult English services
9. **Mock interview setting** - For interview prep service
10. **Before/after grade charts** - Visual improvements

## Next Steps
After restarting Claude Code:
1. Use Unsplash MCP to search for these images
2. Download selected images to `/public/images/`
3. Implement them across the site pages
4. Add proper alt text and optimization
