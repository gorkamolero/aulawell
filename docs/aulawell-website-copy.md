## ABOUT PAGE

### Main Heading

**Your Examiner-Insight Advantage for International Success**

### Opening Section

**From Britain's Top Schools to Your Child's Success**

I'm Amelia Fernández-Kong, and I bring something unique to international education: current examiner experience combined with over a decade teaching in Britain's leading independent schools.

As an active examiner for AQA GCSE English and Cambridge IGCSE/AS & A-Level, I don't just prepare students for exams—I know exactly what examiners are looking for and how to deliver it.

### My Story

**From Russell Group to Global Classroom**

My journey began at one of the UK's top Russell Group universities, followed by earning my QTS (Qualified Teacher Status) and CELTA certification. But it was my years in Britain's most prestigious independent schools that truly shaped my teaching philosophy.

Working with high-achieving students from diverse international backgrounds, I discovered my passion: helping international families navigate the British education system with the same advantages as those born into it.

Now, as both a teacher and examiner, I offer something invaluable—insider knowledge that turns good answers into top-band responses.

### Why Aulawell?

**Because Examiner Insight Makes the Difference**

"Aula" means classroom in Spanish, and "well" represents excellence in education. Aulawell was born from a simple observation: even the best students struggle without understanding what examiners actually want.

Your child might write beautifully or solve problems correctly, but are they hitting the specific assessment objectives? Do they understand the mark scheme nuances that separate 7s from 9s? That's where my dual perspective as teacher and examiner becomes your child's secret weapon.

### My Approach

**Three Pillars of Excellence**

1. **Examiner Intelligence**  
   I decode mark schemes, assessment objectives, and the subtle differences between good and exceptional answers. Your child learns to think like an examiner.

2. **Elite School Standards**  
   Having taught in Britain's top independent schools, I bring those same high expectations and proven methodologies to every student.

3. **Personalised Pathways**  
   From beginners finding their voice to sixth-formers crafting university applications, I design programmes that challenge while building confidence.

### Credentials & Experience

- **Qualified Teacher Status (QTS)** - UK Department for Education
- **CELTA Certified** - Cambridge English Language Assessment
- **Russell Group Graduate** - Top UK University
- **Current Examiner** - AQA GCSE English
- **Current Examiner** - Cambridge IGCSE/AS & A-Level
- **10+ years** in leading UK independent schools
- **Proven Results** - Students consistently achieve 7-9 at GCSE, A/A* at A-Level
- **University Success** - Students accepted to Oxford, Cambridge, LSE, Imperial, and Ivy League
- **Enhanced DBS Checked** - Full clearance for child safety

### The Examiner Advantage

As an active examiner, I see firsthand where students lose marks unnecessarily. This insider knowledge means I can:

- Teach the exact techniques that earn top marks
- Explain why certain answers score higher than others
- Prepare students for the specific style each exam board rewards
- Provide feedback using actual examiner criteria
- Predict and prepare for likely exam questions

### Beyond the Classroom

My passion for education extends beyond tutoring. I regularly attend examiner training sessions, staying current with the latest assessment trends. This commitment to professional development ensures your child always receives cutting-edge preparation.

Living in Madrid has enriched my understanding of international families' needs, combining British educational excellence with the cultural awareness essential for global success.

Every grade improvement represents a child's increased confidence and a family's relief. Here are some of the journeys I've been privileged to be part of.

### Story 1: From Struggling to Soaring

**Sofia's A-Level English Transformation**

**Background:** Sofia moved from Argentina to Madrid in Year 12, facing A-Level English Literature with no understanding of British literary analysis.

**Challenge:** C grades were jeopardizing her dream of studying Medicine at a UK university.

**Approach:** Using my examiner insight, we decoded exactly what Cambridge wanted. We worked on essay structure, critical terminology, and the specific analytical style that scores A*.

**Results:** 
- English Literature: C → A*
- Personal Statement: Crafted to perfection
- Accepted to study Medicine at UCL

> "Amy didn't just tutor Sofia; she showed her exactly what examiners look for. As an examiner herself, Amy knew the 'secret formula' that made all the difference." — Maria, Sofia's mother
